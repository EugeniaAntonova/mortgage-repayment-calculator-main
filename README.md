## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pristine js

### What I learned

After this challenge I can work better with forms markup and styles, session storage, forms validation with pristine. I tried to make user experince as smooth and clear as i could. Also I added a little animation to make it more entertaining. Session storage allows for the user to reload the page and still see their result. When the form is cleared, session storage is also cleared.

### Continued development

Async programming, classes, react.
